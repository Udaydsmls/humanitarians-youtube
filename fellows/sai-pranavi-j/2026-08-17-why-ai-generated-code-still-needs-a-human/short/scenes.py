Manim scenes — 9:16 PORTRAIT SHORT derived from
2026-08-17-why-ai-generated-code-still-needs-a-human

Built via THE SHORTS LAW (runtime/scripts/shorts.py): this reel is UNDER the
180s Shorts cap, so the short is a full reformat — all 9 parent beats kept,
no narration rewritten, every mp3 reused byte-for-byte from the parent's
mp3/ folder (see short/beat_sheet.json). Every beat here is a Manim GRAPHIC
beat, so THE REFORMAT RULE's auto center-cut never applies (generated
graphics are never cropped) — each beat below is a genuine portrait
RE-LAYOUT of the parent ../scenes.py composition, authored by hand for a
1080x1920 canvas, not a mechanical crop.

PORTRAIT GEOMETRY: Manim keeps frame_height fixed at 8 regardless of aspect
(so the vertical safe/hard bounds the parent file already designed against
— to_edge(UP/DOWN, buff=...) — carry over almost unchanged). What changes
is frame_width: 4.5 instead of 14.222, i.e. a hard edge of only +/-2.25 and
a safe band of +/-1.95 (vs the parent's +/-6.3) — SEE
runtime/qc/manim_layout_audit.py's --portrait constants. That is roughly a
3.2x narrower stage. Every wide composition in the parent film — the B02
hook's fix.js/server.log split screen, B04's before/after SQL columns, and
B05's rubric-chips-beside-a-code-panel — is re-composed here as a TOP/BOTTOM
stack instead of LEFT/RIGHT columns, with code re-wrapped onto more, shorter
lines (measured against real Manim Text.width at 1080x1920 — see
BUILD-LOG.md's short-cut entry for the measurement method) rather than
shrunk-to-illegibility by fit()'s safety scaling alone.

MAX_W = 3.6 is this file's general content-width budget (leaves ~0.15
margin inside the portrait safe half-width of 1.95 on each side); code
panels use a tighter ~3.2-3.4. fit() remains the same safety net as the
parent file — most lines below were pre-measured to already clear budget,
so fit() is mostly a no-op backstop, not the primary sizing tool.

clear_of_hdivider() is this file's portrait analogue of the parent's
clear_of_divider(): the same "measure the block's OWN rendered bounds and
shift the whole rigid unit" pattern that fixed the parent's B02 divider bug,
just rotated 90 degrees — every vertical divider (LEFT/RIGHT split) in the
parent becomes a horizontal divider (TOP/BOTTOM stack) here, so it is the
block's top/bottom clearance, not its left/right clearance, that has to be
verified against the divider's position.

Beat-by-beat redesign notes:
  B00 TitleCard      — title re-wrapped 2->4 lines for the narrow column.
  B01 ExecSummary    — badge+name row (side-by-side in the parent) stacked
                       badge-above-name; summary re-wrapped 3->5 short lines.
  B02 HookCrashLog   — THE hook's fix.js/server.log split screen -> fix.js
                       on top, server.log on the bottom, divided by a fixed
                       horizontal rule (clear_of_hdivider protects both
                       blocks from it, mirroring the parent's vertical case).
  B03 FrameworkRubric— each row's badge+label mini-header now sits ABOVE its
                       (full-width) explanation instead of beside a
                       width-starved one.
  B04 WorkedExampleDiff — THE worked example's before/after SQL columns ->
                       BEFORE code panel on top, AFTER panel crossfades in
                       at the exact same anchor once the WHY step needs it
                       (fits inside the existing 0.5s step-transition, so
                       total beat timing is unchanged), separated from the
                       caption zone below by a fixed horizontal divider.
  B05 FalsifiabilityCase — THE falsifiability beat's rubric-chips-beside-
                       code-panel -> chips column ABOVE the code panel.
  B06 ScaffoldedTask — same box+text-column row structure as the parent
                       (already vertical friendly); only the checklist/
                       explanation text is re-wrapped narrower.
  B07 Close          — the checkmark that sat to the RIGHT of the struck
                       old line now sits beside the NEW corrected line
                       instead (old line stacked above, both narrower).
  B08 BrandOutro     — unchanged composition; only widths/rule length trimmed.

Palette/MONO/fit()/panel() are copied verbatim from the parent ../scenes.py
for visual continuity (same humanitarians/hai persona look). See
../scenes.py for the full production history (v1-v4) of this content —
nothing about WHAT is said or WHEN changes here, only how it is laid out.

from manim import *

# CRITICAL PORTRAIT FIX: manim's CLI only derives frame_width from the
# pixel aspect ratio ONCE, inside ManimConfig.digest_parser() at startup —
# BEFORE the -r/--resolution CLI flag is applied (that happens later, in
# digest_args(), via plain pixel_width/pixel_height property setters that do
# NOT recompute frame_width). So a bare `manim -r 2160,3840 scenes.py B00`
# (exactly what runtime/scripts/run.sh invokes) leaves frame_width at the
# 16:9 DEFAULT (14.222...) even though the render is portrait — every
# coordinate in this file was designed against a 4.5-wide frame, so without
# this fix everything renders ~3.2x too small and clustered dead-center
# (the actual root cause of this short's first GATE V pass: 5-19%
# canvas-fill on nearly every beat). This mirrors what
# runtime/qc/manim_layout_audit.py's --portrait mode already does by hand
# for its own dry-run stub — just applied here at real-render time, after
# -r has set config.pixel_width/pixel_height (module import happens after
# manim's CLI arg-parsing, so this always sees the real portrait pixels).

# B04 — WORKED-EXAMPLE: THE big redesign. Parent shows BEFORE (left column)
# and AFTER (right column) simultaneously for the whole 44s beat. Portrait
# has no width for two simultaneous columns of 8+ code lines each, so this
# beat is genuinely re-composed as a SEQUENTIAL single-panel reveal: the
# BEFORE panel occupies the (single) code slot for SETUP/TRACE/CONSEQUENCE
# (all three narrate the before_code), then crossfades to the AFTER panel
# for the WHY step (which narrates the after_code) — landing at the exact
# same anchor, so the swap reads as a clean substitution, not a jump cut.
# The crossfade is folded into the WHY step's existing 0.5s caption
# transition, so total beat timing is UNCHANGED from the parent (43.99s).
# A fixed horizontal divider still separates the code area from the
# caption zone below it — clear_of_hdivider() protects the code panels
# from it (the portrait analogue of the parent's vertical-divider fix).
