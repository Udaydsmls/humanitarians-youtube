# Build log

- 2026-08-03 — Scoped from a template brief for a 5-minute deep-explainer on facial recognition; fellow chose to scope it down to a 3-minute `ai-explainer` instead.
- 2026-08-03 — Verified the brief's central NIST claim against NISTIR 8280 directly (189 algorithms, 18.27M images, demographic gap narrowing for top-tier algorithms) BEFORE drafting narration — see FACTCHECK.md/SOURCES.md. No corrections needed; the brief's numbers were accurate.
- 2026-08-03 — Drafted 8-beat script (Hook / Mechanism / Benefits / Harms / Evidence / Framework / Takeaway / Sign-off), first-person, balanced tone. Fellow approved before any audio generation (GATE P).
- 2026-08-03 — Sign-off beat explicitly credits the fellow by name ("in for Sai Pranavi Jeedigunta"), per the fellowship's compliance requirement that videos demonstrably come from the volunteer.
- 2026-08-03 — Voice: kept Bella (`af_bella`) / `hai` persona / `@HumanitariansAI`, consistent with this fellow's prior weekly report.
- Authored `beat_sheet.json`, `SOURCES.md`, `FACTCHECK.md`, `PEDAGOGY.md`, `BUILD-PROMPT.md`.
- OPEN — `scenes.py` (8 Manim scenes), audio generation, previz, GATE A/W/B/V passes.
- NOT AUTHORIZED — Publishing.

## 2026-08-25/26 — 4K rebuild + 2 new opening beats (program feedback)

- 2026-08-25 — Re-read the brutalist toolkit fresh (it had just been pulled to
  latest upstream — `static_scene_check.py`, `run.sh`, `generate_audio_kokoro.py`
  all changed, plus a new `RENDER-4K-AND-UPLOAD.md` doc and a new `gate_shape.py`
  QC). Confirmed `runtime/scripts/run.sh`'s default `HEIGHT` is now `2160`
  (4K-native, comment: "was 1080") and `./art final` also defaults to
  `--height 2160` — so no special flag was needed to hit the 4K requirement,
  just running the current toolkit as-is. `gate_shape.py` only applies to
  finance reels (checks `metadata.ticker`/`FINANCE_ACTS`) — not applicable here.
- 2026-08-25 — Read the sibling reel's v3 renumbering precedent
  (`2026-08-17-why-ai-generated-code-still-needs-a-human/scenes.py` +
  `BUILD-LOG.md`, 2026-08-17 entries) for the exact mechanics of adding a
  title-card beat at the front of an already-built reel: (1) a REAL silent
  mp3 via `ffmpeg -f lavfi -i anullsrc=r=44100:cl=stereo`, never
  `audio_file: null` — traced `compile.py`'s `build_master_audio()` and
  confirmed it requires `all(p.exists() for p in per_beat)` across every beat
  or the ENTIRE film's audio falls back to silence, not just the null beat;
  (2) mechanical class rename to new `B0N` prefixes; (3) clearing stale
  `manim/*.mp4`/`clips/*.mp4` before re-render, since beat-ID-keyed clips
  from the old numbering would otherwise silently fill the new slots under
  the same IDs.
- 2026-08-25 — Renumbered per program feedback: added `B00_TitleCard` (silent
  — video title + `@HumanitariansAI`, no VO) and `B01_ExecSummary` (spoken
  personal-intro card — fellow's name, role, one-line thesis summary,
  narration text supplied verbatim by the program). All 10 previously-existing
  beats (`B00_EverywhereHook`...`B09_BrandOutro`) shifted to `B02`...`B11` in
  both `scenes.py` (class renames) and `beat_sheet.json` (`beat_id`,
  `audio_file`, `shot.manim.scene`). `mp3/beat-B00.mp3`...`beat-B09.mp3`
  renamed to `beat-B02.mp3`...`beat-B11.mp3` in descending order (B09→B11
  first, ..., B00→B02 last) to avoid clobbering, since the old and new ID
  ranges overlap (B02-B09). Re-verified via `ffprobe` that every renamed mp3's
  measured duration is byte-for-byte identical to its pre-rebuild
  `actual_duration_s` — all 10 matched exactly (no regeneration, no drift).
- 2026-08-25 — Generated `mp3/beat-B01.mp3` via
  `generate_audio_kokoro.py --only B01` (af_bella, this reel's existing
  voice) — measured 11.66s. Generated `mp3/beat-B00.mp3` via ffmpeg anullsrc,
  measured 4.60s (target 4.55s, same as the sibling reel's title-card
  precedent — off by rounding to the nearest mp3 frame). Retuned both new
  scenes' `self.wait()` calls to match: B00's bracketed-title reveal
  (0.35+0.8+0.5 play-time + 2.95 wait = 4.60s native) and B01's card reveal
  (0.6+0.7+0.35+0.6+1.1 play-time + 8.31 wait = 11.66s native).
- 2026-08-25 — Wrote `B00_TitleCard` and `B01_ExecSummary` in `scenes.py`,
  reusing this reel's own PALETTE (humanitarians: cream/ink/gold) rather than
  copying the sibling reel's palette. B00 follows that reel's bracketed-title
  convention exactly (rule above AND below, not just an underline, so a
  title-only card still uses a real share of the safe frame). B01 is new —
  not a copy of any existing beat — an avatar-circle-with-initials +
  name + role chip + two-line summary, built for shape-distinctness (avatar
  circle, underline, role chip = 3 distinct non-text shape-states) per this
  file's own documented GATE A lesson.
- 2026-08-25 — GATE A (`static_scene_check.py`) and GATE W
  (`wcag_margin_check.py --palette humanitarians`, since this reel's palette
  is `humanitarians` and `run.sh`'s own call to Gate W does not pass
  `--palette` explicitly — it reads `$ART_PALETTE`/`$VOX_PALETTE` from the
  environment, defaulting to `teardown` if unset) run on `B00_TitleCard` and
  `B01_ExecSummary` before any render: both clean (B00: 2 distinct shape
  states; B01: 3 distinct shape states; no WCAG/margin/overlap findings).
  Exported `ART_PALETTE=humanitarians` before every subsequent `run.sh`/
  `compile.py` invocation so Gate W checks against the reel's real palette,
  not the toolkit default.
- 2026-08-25 — Cleared all stale `manim/*.mp4`, `clips/*.mp4`, `media/*`,
  `layout_audit.{json,md}`, `qc-sheet.png`, and the old 1080p master +
  `-slate.mp4` before re-render, per the sibling reel's documented precedent
  (old beat-ID-keyed clips would otherwise silently fill the wrong new slot
  now that the numbering shifted).
- 2026-08-25 — Ran `runtime/scripts/run.sh` (4K native, `ART_PALETTE=humanitarians`):
  rendered all 12 Manim scenes fresh at 3840x2160@24fps, GATE A/W clean,
  GATE B (post-render layout audit) clean ("21 snapshots → CLEAN"), compiled
  both the review (`-slate.mp4`) and clean master cuts, 12/12 beats filled,
  0 slates.
- 2026-08-25 — GATE V (frame-level QC): the automated `run.sh` pass checks
  the watermarked `-slate.mp4` by default (`final_frame_check.py`'s own
  fallback glob prefers `*-slate.mp4` when no `--mp4` is given) and reported
  30 BLOCKER — this is the documented false-positive edge-bleed from the
  review timecode burn-in, confirmed again here, NOT a real defect. Ran
  `final_frame_check.py --mp4 <true clean master>` directly instead, per
  this project's own prior-build precedent: **0 BLOCKER, 12 MAJOR**.
- 2026-08-25 — Investigated all 12 MAJOR findings by direct frame extraction
  (`ffmpeg -ss <exact GATE-V sample timestamp>`) rather than trusting the
  automated report, per PROOF.md's own rule ("never infer a pass or a fail —
  ask for the frame"). Found **one real, genuine defect**: B04's caption
  ("A 98% match is a probability, not a certainty.") used a letter-tracing
  `Write()` whose animation window (native 7.4s-8.2s of a 15.2s-native scene
  stretched 1.39x to fill its measured 21.12s audio) straddled the GATE V
  50%-of-beat sample point (native halfway = 7.6s) — the extracted frame
  showed a half-drawn, overlapping glyph mess. This is exactly the failure
  mode this file's own docstring warns about ("settle into the final static
  state comfortably before 50% of the scene's own native runtime") and
  pre-dates this rebuild (same unedited scene code, just newly caught because
  GATE V was properly run against the true master this time, not skipped).
  **Fixed**: swapped `Write(caption)` → `FadeIn(caption)` (no partial-glyph
  tracing at any sample point) and shaved 0.8s off the earlier build-up
  (`wait(0.4)`→`wait(0.1)`, caption `run_time` 0.8→0.3) so the caption is
  fully settled by native 7.4s, comfortably ahead of the 7.6s halfway mark.
  Re-ran GATE A/W on `B04_PipelineMechanism` (clean), cleared its stale
  `manim/B04.mp4`/`clips/B04.mp4`, and re-rendered just that scene.
  Re-extracted the same frame post-fix: clean, fully legible caption.
- 2026-08-25/26 — The first `run.sh` re-render pass was killed by an
  environment tool timeout (5 min) partway through the final (non-review)
  `compile.py` ffmpeg mux, which corrupted the in-progress master
  (`moov atom not found`). All Manim renders and per-beat `clips/*.mp4` had
  already completed successfully before the kill, so re-ran only
  `compile.py --height 2160 --force` (no re-render needed) in the background
  to avoid the same timeout; it completed cleanly.
- 2026-08-26 — Final GATE V pass on the true clean master (re-verified after
  the B04 fix, fresh compile): **0 BLOCKER, 12 MAJOR** — B04's finding
  dropped from a real defect to the same class of cosmetic `low-contrast`
  heuristic finding as B02 (both: whole-frame luminance-average penalizes a
  mostly-cream frame with a small dark-text area; direct WCAG computation on
  the actual palette gives ink-on-cream **11.99:1** — nearly 3x the AAA bar —
  confirmed legible by eye on the extracted frame). Remaining 4 underfill
  findings (B01/B05/B06/B11, 6-41% safe-area fill) reviewed by eye: all four
  are intentionally sparse/centered card layouts (personal-intro card, short
  3-4 item lists, compact brand outro), not accidents. No BLOCKER-level
  finding on the true master at any point in this rebuild.
- 2026-08-26 — **FINAL 4K MASTER RENDERED**:
  `2026-07-27-how-facial-recognition-actually-works.mp4`, 3840x2160 @24fps,
  **185.17s**, 12/12 beats real MANIM media (no slates), audio: per-beat
  Kokoro narration (10 beats unchanged, 1 new spoken beat) + 1 real silent
  track (B00). Review cut (`-slate.mp4`) regenerated alongside for reference.
- 2026-08-26 — Wrote `SELF-ASSESSMENT.md`: scored this rebuilt master against
  PROOF.md's own six-criterion teaching rubric (**10/12** — explicit
  framework 2, reusable rubric 2, worked example 2, falsifiability/edge case
  1, active task 2, friction 1) and PROOF.md's binary Production Gate
  (**PASS** on all three sub-checks, after the B04 fix above). Named the
  honest gap: the 3-question framework has never been shown *failing* or
  straining against an ambiguous case (B05/B06/B09 each resolve cleanly to
  one stakes-bucket, the "one-per-example" pattern PROOF explicitly warns
  against) — logged as a future-pass punch-list item, not fixed in this
  rebuild (out of scope for a resolution/beat-count program-feedback pass).
  This reel's own `beat_sheet.json.metadata.gates.publish` remains
  **NOT AUTHORIZED** — PROOF's rubric verdict is not a publish authorization.
- GATES CLOSED (this rebuild) — plan (re-approved for the 4K + 2-beat scope),
  fact-check (unchanged, no new factual claims in B00/B01), narration
  (B01 approved, exact program-supplied text; B00 silent by design), audio
  lock (B00/B01 generated, B02-B11 re-verified byte-identical), previz (12/12
  real media, 4K), GATE A/W/B (clean), GATE V (0 BLOCKER / 12 MAJOR, all
  cosmetic, one real defect found-and-fixed). Publishing: **NOT AUTHORIZED**
  (unchanged — separate human fellowship sign-off, out of scope for this
  rebuild per the task's own instruction not to push/upload).

## 2026-08-28 — 9:16 SHORT built from the 4K master (`short/`)

- **Cap check**: parent is 185.3s (3:05.3), ~5.3s over the 180s Shorts cap.
  Ran `runtime/scripts/shorts.py` with no flags first — the auto-plan
  proposed dropping **B07** (EVIDENCE, 31.27s), the single longest beat, but
  also the video's factual backbone (the NIST FRVT demographic-accuracy
  finding — the only hard evidence in the whole script). Re-ran with
  `--keep B07` to protect it; the planner's next-best cut was **B09**
  (WORKED-EXAMPLE, 26.86s), landing at ~179.0s. Kept that plan: the
  framework (B03) and the CTA (B10) both still carry the "ask three
  questions" pedagogy without the retail worked-example application, and
  losing a worked example is a smaller loss than losing the only cited
  primary-source evidence in the script.
- B11 (SIGN-OFF)'s narration was rewritten by `shorts.py` (dropped-beat
  rule): *"That's the short version. The full video also covers Try the
  lens on one… — watch How Facial Recognition Actually Works (And When It
  Shouldn't) for the whole story. The link is right below."* — the
  mid-sentence teaser text is `shorts.py`'s own auto-derivation (first 5
  words of the dropped beat's narration_text; there's no `graphic.
  production_viz.label` field to give it a cleaner handle) and reads a
  little awkwardly as a quoted title, but this is the tool's documented,
  by-design behavior, not something to hand-edit around. Regenerated via
  `generate_audio_kokoro.py` (ONLY beat re-synthesized — 11.95s, up from
  the parent's 4.92s sign-off). The silent endcard's "Next:" line was set
  via `--next "a full worked example, applying this lens to a real retail
  case"` for a cleaner phrase than the auto-derived default.
- Wrote `short/SHOTLIST.md` and `short/PROMPTS.md` (missing after the
  scaffold — `short/FACTCHECK.md` was auto-generated by `shorts.py`, but
  GATE F in `run.sh` also requires these two, which the short-scaffolding
  step doesn't create).
- **Portrait `scenes.py` authored from scratch** (11 classes, one per kept
  beat — B09 excluded). This was genuine layout redesign, not a crop:
  - **Geometry gotcha found the hard way**: Manim CE does not shrink
    `frame_width` for a portrait `-r` resolution — it leaves frame_width at
    its 16:9 default (~14.2 units) and grows `frame_height` instead
    (~25.3 units, confirmed via a direct probe scene printing
    `self.camera.frame_width/height`). A first authoring pass (correctly
    narrowed widths, but rendered with no frame-width override) GATE-V-failed
    at 5-8% canvas fill on **every single beat** — real extracted contact-
    sheet frames showed all content clustered in the top slice of a much
    taller canvas. The fix, already named and documented in the toolkit
    itself (`runtime/manim/animated_graphics.py`'s "Portrait sync (the
    bn_layout fix)" comment): explicitly recompute `config.frame_width =
    config.frame_height * (pixel_width/pixel_height)` at import time,
    keeping `frame_height` fixed at 8.0. `short/scenes.py` now carries this
    exact patch at its top. This also resolved a GATE A false-alarm
    (`static_scene_check.py` hardcodes a 16:9 mock frame and briefly flagged
    a B04 arrow coordinate as "outside the frame" before the patch — a real
    geometry mismatch at the time, not a tool bug, and it disappeared once
    the patch made the actual render match the intended ~4.5x8 working
    frame that GATE B's own `--portrait` mode already assumes).
  - **Structural (not just resized) redesigns**, per the task brief:
    - B02 (context chips): horizontal row (`arrange(RIGHT)`, ~11.9 units
      wide) → vertical column.
    - B04 (pipeline diagram — detect→embed→compare→score): 4 boxes in a
      horizontal row, face icon further left still → single vertical
      column, face on top, arrows now point DOWN instead of RIGHT.
    - B07 (NIST evidence chart): two vertical bars side-by-side
      (LEFT*2.3/RIGHT*2.3) → two HORIZONTAL bars (rightward fill =
      magnitude of the demographic gap) stacked vertically — reads
      top-to-bottom as "most algorithms" then "best-performing", a more
      portrait-native comparison layout than a narrowed side-by-side would
      have been.
    - B08 (fluency-trap split panel): two boxes side-by-side at
      LEFT*3.0/RIGHT*3.0 (width 4.4 each — nearly the entire 16:9 frame on
      its own) → stacked top/bottom.
    - B09's worked-example Q&A rows (also called out in the task brief as
      needing portrait rework) did **not** need redesigning — B09 was the
      beat the auto-plan dropped, so it isn't in this short at all.
    - B00/B01/B03/B05/B06/B10/B11 were already vertically-organized in the
      parent — these needed re-indenting/narrowing and one real defect fix
      (below), not restructuring.
  - **Real defect found via frame extraction** (not just the automated
    report): B03's `Write(thesis)` animation straddled its scene's 50%
    GATE V sample point — the extracted frame showed garbled, overlapping
    glyphs ("Scrutin[y] sho[uld]..."), the exact same failure class as the
    parent's own B04 fix. Fixed identically: `Write()` → `FadeIn()`.
- **QC**: GATE A + GATE W (`ART_PALETTE=humanitarians`) run and clean on
  all 11 scenes before every render pass. GATE B (post-render layout audit)
  clean. GATE V run directly against the TRUE clean master
  (`--mp4 short/2026-07-27-how-facial-recognition-actually-works-short.mp4`),
  never the `-slate.mp4` — `run.sh`'s own automated GATE V step defaults to
  the slate and reported 24 false BLOCKERs (the same watermark-edge
  false-positive this project's parent build already documented); the
  direct check against the true master reported **0 BLOCKER** throughout.
  Iterated on GATE V's MAJOR findings against real frames, not the report
  alone:
  - `underfill` on B00/B06/B11 (51%/52%/16% canvas fill, below the 55%
    floor) — all three were genuinely under-spaced, not false positives;
    real extracted frames showed well-composed but too-compact cards/lists.
    Fixed by widening rules/accents and increasing buffs (B00: buff
    1.0→1.35, rules 1.5→1.75; B06: row spacing 1.3→1.65; B11: buff
    0.4→1.9, accent rule 2.4→3.8 units wide — B11 has the least "content"
    of any kept beat, and its rewritten 11.95s outro gives it plenty of
    screen time to spend on generous spacing). Final measured fill: B00
    and B06 pass; B11 clears the floor.
  - `low-contrast` on B01/B02/B04 (6 findings, whole-frame luminance
    average) — verified as the same class of false positive the parent
    build already documented: direct WCAG computation on this reel's exact
    palette gives ink-on-cream **11.99:1** (identical hex values, reused
    byte-for-byte from the parent's `scenes.py`), nearly 3x the AAA
    threshold. The heuristic dilutes contrast across mostly-cream frames
    with a modest amount of dark text — not a real legibility defect.
  - `underfill` on END (27%) — the silent branded endcard
    (`short/media/END.png`) is generated directly by `shorts.py`'s own
    `endcard_png()` function, not by `short/scenes.py`. This is a toolkit-
    level layout choice outside this task's scope (brutalist/ is
    read-only) — flagged here for a human to consider if `shorts.py`'s
    endcard generator is ever revisited.
- **FINAL 9:16 MASTER**:
  `short/2026-07-27-how-facial-recognition-actually-works-short.mp4` —
  **1080x1920, 24fps, 169.98s**. 12/12 slots filled with real media (11
  MANIM beats + 1 STILL endcard), 0 slates, confirmed via `ffprobe` and
  `beat_sheet.json`'s per-beat `build.status`. Review cut (`-slate.mp4`)
  written alongside for reference.
- Publishing: **NOT AUTHORIZED** (same as the parent — separate human
  sign-off; this build does not push, upload, or publish to the "Shorts"
  playlist).
