## What this video is about

Madison weekly. One numbered receipt, three other tracks:

- **SurveyMind.** ~603,000 usable personality responses loaded and cleaned. Analysis code proven on two synthetic sets (looks-real passed; built-wrong failed). **Real SurveyMind run is next — dummy is not a result.**
- **Loon Conservatory:** first desktop app under test for user-facing issues; full-stack features being finished and refined. Not a launch.
- **Laptop recommendation study** (separate): small manual ChatGPT pilot on approved prompts; collect responses; review brands vs added user context.
- **Jungian brand-archetype detector:** prove the full pipeline on **Ruler** (luxury) before all twelve. Inputs / scoring-with-evidence / hand-labeled evaluation.
