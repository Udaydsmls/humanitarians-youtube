# Fellowship Renewal Request — Uday Sonawane

**Project:** Mycroft market-sentiment pipeline + Humanitarians AI video series
**Group:** Mycroft
**Current agreement:** 21 August 2026 → 30 September 2026
**Requested renewal:** 1 October 2026 → 31 December 2026
**Reporting period:** 21 August → 25 September 2026 (5 weeks, 111 hours)

### Where the evidence is

- **Finished videos** are in Google Drive, linked per week below.
- **GitHub folders** hold each video's source — script, scene code, fact-check and sources — **not the video files**, which the repository excludes by policy.
- **Pipeline code** is in `nikbearbrown/mycroft`, linked per pull request.

## Summary

The Mycroft market-sentiment pipeline described six processing steps in its recipe, but none of them had been written. All eleven scripts belonging to that recipe were copies of the same empty 74-line template — including the ones meant to fetch data, which made no network calls at all.

Over the first four weeks I wrote all six steps. Each was submitted as a pull request and all four have been merged into `nikbearbrown/mycroft`. In week five I claimed the promotion the evidence already supported — closing the recipe's open markers, recording the gate decisions, and fixing two gates that were passing for the wrong reason.

**My contribution:** I am the sole author of the pipeline pull requests and of all ten videos — script, scene code, fact-check and render for each.

To show the steps actually work rather than merely run, I also built a test set of 18 deliberately broken records. Each defect is assigned in advance to the step that is supposed to catch it, so the result is a number rather than an opinion: all 18 are caught, at the exact locations expected.

Alongside the engineering I produced ten videos, about 33 minutes in total. Five document the pipeline work itself; five explain AI and STEM topics. All are merged into `nikbearbrown/humanitarians-youtube`.

**Hours: 111 across five weeks — 22, 23, 20, 20, 26. Every week at or above 20, each with a dated frictional log.**

Together: 4 commits, 53 files, roughly 8,900 new lines.

### Week five — claiming the promotion the evidence supported

Six step scripts existed, but the recipe still said they did not. That gap was closed:

- **All 13 `[TODO: DEV]` markers closed**, though not uniformly — the six canonical steps closed with evidence, while six legacy n8n node markers closed as mappings. Two of those (Parse Question & Extract Tickers, Webhook Response) were never built and now say so, rather than implying six more scripts exist.
- **Lifecycle frontmatter added** — status `RUNNABLE-SAMPLE`, `recipe_version 0.2.0`, `todos_open 2`, `attestation null`. The two remaining TODOs are real markers in the recipe body, so the count can be grepped rather than taken on trust.
- **`logs/gate-decisions/` created** with records for gates 1–4, each carrying evidence hashes, `residual_risk` and `voids_if`. Gates 5 and 6 are deliberately absent: writing gate 5 would be a false clearance, because no live or model call has run.
- **Three contract fixes** — step 3 gained `type_errors` (a wrong-typed value matched none of its five declared fields); the report's Reader is now the compliance/audit reviewer the artifact actually serves; the template's log path now matches the recipe.
- **Two gates that could be satisfied by doing nothing** — gates 4 and 5 each passed if their artifact existed *or* if a TODO marker was still present. Both now have real failure paths, with gate 5 break-tested across all three cases.

Frictional log: [recipe promotion and gate fixes](../frictional-logs/2026-09-25-recipe-promotion-and-gate-fixes.md) · commits `d6f5b90`, `55546b5`, `4157a8e`. **Not yet merged upstream.**

### How the steps are designed

Each step is deliberately limited, so that evidence of a problem survives long enough for the step responsible for catching it to do so.

- **Ingest moves data; it does not fix it.** If it quietly corrected the wrong record count or skipped the unreadable file, step 3 would have nothing left to find.
- **The quality check marks bad rows; it does not delete or convert them.** Stale and wrong-typed rows stay in the data, flagged.
- **The scoring step reproduces the original arithmetic exactly**, but raises a named flag every time that original quietly substitutes a value — for example treating `"N/A"` as zero, or falling back to a score of 50 that looks like a neutral reading when it actually means "no data".
- **The final report separates what was measured from what was inferred**, and links each figure back to the hash of the file it came from.

Each step was also tested for what it must *not* catch, so responsibilities do not overlap: step 3 leaves all ten of step 4's defects alone.

### Why this matters

Running the clean test set and the deliberately corrupted one produces the **same headline score — 64, "slightly bullish"** — even though four rows beneath one of them are contaminated. The number alone cannot tell the two apart. The flags can, which is why the steps raise them.

## 2. Ten videos (about 33 minutes)

**Mycroft engineering series** — four episodes covering the pipeline work above. Each is tied to a specific commit and picks up where the previous episode's open list of unfinished items left off. The series ends with all six steps written.

## Gaps and limits of this evidence

Stated plainly so they are not discovered later:

- **Week five's engineering is not yet upstream.** The promotion, gate decisions and gate fixes exist as commits (`d6f5b90`, `55546b5`, `4157a8e`) but have no pull request in `nikbearbrown/mycroft`; the most recent merged one is [#48](https://github.com/nikbearbrown/mycroft/pull/48) from 18 September. Opening that PR is the first item in the October plan.
- **The two newest videos have no `BUILD-LOG.md`.** The earlier eight each carry one, which doubles as that video's own frictional log. For week five the engineering frictional log exists, but the two videos themselves have no build record.
- **The frictional logs here are copies.** The working originals stay private in the `mycroft` repository; these are the same records, published so they can be opened as evidence.
- **The GitHub folders do not contain the videos.** They hold each video's script, scene code, fact-check and source list. The finished videos are only in the Drive folders linked above.
- **Weekly hours are self-reported.** The frictional logs are dated per step and record what was worked on, and the pull requests and build timestamps show dated output, but none of these is a timesheet: they evidence *work done*, not hours counted.
- **Two claims in this report are evidenced in the `mycroft` repository rather than here** — the 18-defect corpus result and the counts of untested files and undocumented commands. They are visible in the merged pull requests linked above.

## Next period — October 2026

Each phase is ordered so it unblocks the one after it.

### Week 1 — close out the finished recipe and get it upstream

Most of this phase was pulled forward into week five of the reporting period — the recipe is promoted, the markers are closed, and gates 1–4 are recorded. What remains:

- **By 2 Oct** — open the pull request for the promotion and gate-fix commits (`d6f5b90`, `55546b5`, `4157a8e`). None of that work is in `nikbearbrown/mycroft` yet.
- **By 5 Oct** — write the `RUN_LOG.md` entry covering steps 1–6. The reports still refer to scripts that no logged run produced, which breaks the chain from report back to source. This is the last piece of the promotion that is not yet evidenced.
- **By 7 Oct** — resolve the two TODOs the recipe now declares openly: a DEFINE on step 5's unattributed scoring constants, and an APPROVE on gate 5.

### Week 2 — make the automated checks actually check

- **By 9 Oct** — add a pytest job to CI. At present CI runs none of the 72 Python test files that already exist in the repository.
- **By 12 Oct** — fix the skip list in `conformance.mjs`. It currently excludes `data`, `ingest`, `gigo` and `tools`, which means the verification command never looks at a recipe's step scripts.
- **By 13 Oct** — clear the manifest drift — six generated files are out of sync, which is why the verification command does not report clean.
- **By 14 Oct** — apply the `.gitattributes` line-ending rules across the whole repository, not just the two folders currently covered. Otherwise file hashes differ between Windows and Linux, which matters anywhere a hash is used as proof.

### Weeks 3–4 — build the `snickerdoodle` command-line tool

97 of the 99 recipes describe a command-line tool that has never been built. Each recipe tells the reader to run commands like `snickerdoodle run <recipe> --step <name>` and `snickerdoodle gate <recipe> --gate N --decision approve`. In practice the six steps are run by calling the Python scripts directly.

- **By 22 Oct** — build `run` first. The six steps already share one interface — the same input, output and dry-run options, results printed as JSON, and a non-zero exit when the run should stop — so there is a working pattern to follow.
- **By 28 Oct** — build `gate`, which generates the gate-decision records that were written by hand in week five.

### Ongoing — reuse the test-fixture approach

The approach behind the 18-defect corpus is not specific to this recipe: a frozen set of test data, a manifest saying which step must catch which defect, and a checker that confirms it did. Turning that into a shared format would let other recipes be graded on what they catch, rather than only on whether they run.
