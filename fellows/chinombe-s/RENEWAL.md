# Renewal request — Simbaremuteuro Chinombe

**Current agreement:** 21 Aug — 30 Sep
**Requested period:** 1 Oct — 31 Dec

**Project:** Mycroft — Adaptive Model Routing & Inference Gateway
**Repository:** https://github.com/nikbearbrown/mycroft
**Branch:** `chinombesimbaremuteuro/adaptive-model-routing`

## What the current period produced

Five sprints of a measurement-first routing gateway. All evidence is in the
repository above, and every figure below traces to a logged row rather than an
estimate.

- An append-only logbook where every model call's cost, latency, tier and
  routing reason are recorded before the caller gets its answer — 168 tests, no
  runtime dependencies.
- Six task types locked to evidence already in the repository, a rules router,
  and 24 fixtures hand-labelled and frozen before any model was run on them.
- A live sweep of the whole fixture set: 24 requests, 8% escalation, 0% failure,
  $0.00250, p50 393 ms. Escalated requests were 8% of requests and 23% of spend.
- A pairwise quality judge that runs every comparison twice with the answers
  swapped, so position bias appears as a recorded disagreement instead of a
  result. It established that judging a pair costs 2.4x producing it, which is
  why it stays out of the request path.
- Five bugs that produced *plausible, wrong* numbers rather than errors — silent
  row loss on Windows concurrent appends, a summary that counted another run's
  requests, and two checks that failed correct answers over formatting. All
  documented in `scripts/gateway/FINDINGS.md`.
- Five STEM explainers on inference economics, two published so far.

listed in [README.md](README.md).

## Plan for the requested period

Sprints 6–9, in order, each gating the next:

1. **Measure the scorer** (28 Sep – 2 Oct). Hand-score 30 answer pairs blind;
   report agreement per task type. If agreement is poor, report that quality
   cannot be measured reliably for that task rather than tuning the judge until
   it agrees.
2. **Baseline** (5–9 Oct). Every fixture on all three tiers, repeated runs, cost
   reported as a spread rather than a single figure.
3. **Decision** (12–16 Oct). Implement the break-even rule and decide against
   thresholds fixed in August: >20% cheaper at equal quality, <20% slower.
   "Don't ship" is an acceptable outcome and will be published as one.
4. **Build the chosen option** (19–23 Oct). Package it as a service other Mycroft
   projects can call or a rules table they can copy, with reliability testing and
   documentation for both audiences.
5. **Future Work** (from 26 Oct). Choose the next topic, propose and carry it out.

Reporting continues as it has: a dated Frictional log per work folder, weekly
hours, and a RUN_LOG entry plus findings in the project repository.
